# Rainfall & Runoff Automation Toolkit
Copyright 2025 Muhammad Irfan Ananta

A Python-based open source toolkit for automating rainfall and runoff design workflows, tailored for water resources engineers and hydrologists. This project aims to simplify and accelerate hydrologic modeling using open data and tools like SWMM and QGIS.

⚠️ **Note:** This toolkit is currently under development. Automation for data validation is still on progress. A new toolkit focusing on validation and integration between external software will be released soon.


## 🌧️ Overview

This repository provides scripts and utilities to:
- Automate rainfall design using statistical methods and IDF curves
- Generate runoff parameters from land use and topographic data (future feature)
- Integrate with SWMM for hydraulic simulation (future feature)
- Use QGIS for spatial data preprocessing (future feature)

## 📦 Features

- Python-based automation for hydrologic design
- Support for DEM, land use, and rainfall data (future feature)
- Easy integration with PySWMM and QGIS (future feature)
- Modular and extensible codebase (future feature)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required Python packages
